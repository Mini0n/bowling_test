# Bowling

![program](https://i.imgur.com/uiyjWTx.png)

this is a two days working solution.

Please spare my testing.

whom would knew bowling rules is so codeable.

- Testing would had require stubbing

  - code handles errors, is solid
  - error first writen

- Solving the game
  - at first I though of creating a class for each ball, each frame... seemed fit
  - but i had all the info, so it was a better solution to create a solving function
  - quicker and without the fuzzle
  - light in memory
  - just do the math

# Running the tests

`cd bowling`

`rspec`

# Running the code

`cd bowling`

`bundle install`

`cd lib`

`ruby bowling.rb`

# Addedum

I made the screen score print to honor the guy in the video.

His explanaition was really good. He solved it. I just coded it.
